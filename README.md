<!--On 9-3-2020, I worked with Christina Starr and my tutor Ariel Razonwho helped me understand a few specific points to include: NaN 'Not a Number' property for line 53 and falsy values '!var' for line 91.>

<!--Ariel Razon also helped me format my for loop to take in my passwordLength so the return value stops at the desired password length. Then worked with me to create a function that randomizes and joins together the elements within the users' selected arrays - and returns as a string.
